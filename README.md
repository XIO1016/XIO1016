ðŸŒŠ I'm XIO, a developer who pursues learning and growth.

âœ¨ After thinking that you have to try it yourself to find your aptitude, I have experienced and learned various skills. I was attracted to APP development, which provides services directly to users,and backend development, which constructs optimal codes and queries and designs DBs. I try to continuously develop in various development fields.

ðŸŒ± I'm very interested in growing together. I am very interested in open-source projects, and I am trying to contribute in various ways and enjoying the culture of development.
